## **Biography**

I am a **Senior Machine Learning Engineer and Researcher** focused on the internal mechanics of Large Language Models. My work sits at the intersection of high-scale engineering and academic research, with a particular emphasis on Multimodal AI , inference optimization, and mechanistic interpretability. 

Currently, I am investigating **mechanistic triggers** to detect post-hoc reasoning in LLM mathematics. It uses Logit Lens and Causal Tracing to identify the Answer Emergence Layer—the point in the residual stream where a model commits to a numerical answer before generating its Chain-of-Thought (CoT).

Previously, I developed **audioprefdb**, a specialized audio preference database used to train models via Direct Preference Optimization (**DPO**). My technical toolkit includes deep expertise in Transformers, Vision Models, and optimization frameworks like FlashAttention, Mamba (SSMs), and ONNX.

### **Beyond the Code**
Inspired by **Charlie Munger’s** multidisciplinary approach, I often look for mental models outside of computer science. I am deeply interested in:
* **Philosophy & Literature:** The existentialism of **Albert Camus** and **Kafka**, the psychological depth of **Dostoevsky**, and the strategic insights of **Machiavelli**.
* **Art:** I enjoy creating detailed **artistic pen sketches**, often capturing themes like the Myth of Sisyphus or ships in turmoil—capturing the "inner turmoil" much like I try to do with model weights.

### **Research Interests**
* **Reasoning Models:** Scaling laws during inference and reasoning chain rerankers.
* **Mechanistic Interpretability:** Dissecting the causal traces of model behavior.
* **Alignment:** Advanced post-training techniques including DPO and RLHF.
