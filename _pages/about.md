## **Biography**

I am a **Senior Machine Learning Engineer and Researcher** dedicated to the internal mechanics of Large Language Models. My work sits at the intersection of high-scale engineering and academic research, with a focus on **Multimodal AI, inference optimization, and mechanistic interpretability**. 

Currently, I am investigating **mechanistic triggers** to detect post-hoc reasoning in LLM mathematics. Utilizing tools like **Logit Lens** and **Causal Tracing**, I aim to identify the **Answer Emergence Layer**—the specific point in the residual stream where a model commits to a numerical answer before generating its Chain-of-Thought (CoT).

Previously, I developed **audioprefdb**, a specialized audio preference database used to train models via Direct Preference Optimization (**DPO**). I also have significant experience in **Scientific Machine Learning (SciML)**, where I applied Neural ODEs and Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) to recover underlying dynamics in ecological systems like the Lotka-Volterra model, specifically identifying forecasting breakdown points and robustness under Gaussian noise.

**I am actively looking for independent researchers to collaborate with on projects involving mechanistic interpretability and LLM reasoning. If you are interested in dissecting how these models think, please reach out!**

### **Research Interests**
* **Mechanistic Interpretability:** Dissecting the causal traces of model behavior.
* **Reasoning Models:** Scaling laws during inference and reasoning chain rerankers.
* **Alignment:** Advanced post-training techniques including DPO and RLHF.

### **Beyond the Code**
Inspired by **Charlie Munger’s** multidisciplinary approach, I often look for mental models outside of computer science:
* **Philosophy & Literature:** The existentialism of **Albert Camus** and **Kafka**, the psychological depth of **Dostoevsky**, and the strategic insights of **Machiavelli**.
* **History:** I am an avid reader of history, seeking to understand the patterns of the past to better predict the trajectories of the future.
* **Art:** I enjoy creating detailed **artistic pen sketches**, often capturing themes like the Myth of Sisyphus or ships in turmoil—an attempt to visualize "inner turmoil" much like I do with model weights.
